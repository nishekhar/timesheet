        <p>For all evil things, and all evil destiny, are really rooted in greed, hate and ignorance; and of these three things
    ignorance or delusion (moha, avijja) is the chief root and the primary cause of all evil and misery in the world. If
    there is no more ignorance, there will be no more greed and hatred, no more rebirth, no more suffering</p>
